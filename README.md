## Hi there 👋

I'm a recent graduate passionate about full-stack development, scalable system design, and building products that solve real user problems.
I’m currently developing an end-to-end web application project that covers everything from frontend UI/UX and backend APIs to databases, authentication, and cloud deployment — aiming to grow into a Full-Stack / Software Engineer role in a fast-paced tech environment.

## 📫 Feel free to reach out to me through GitHub or LinkedIn!
